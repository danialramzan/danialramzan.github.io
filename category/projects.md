### Dynamic Billiards
**Duration:** January 2021 - July 2024  
**Associated with:** The University of British Columbia  
A Python project demonstrating the principles of dynamic billiards through various collision scenarios, originally created during high school as a proof of concept for collisions based on Newton's Law of Restitution. Expanded to include more complex collision simulations.

- **Linear Collisions:** Simulates two objects colliding in a straight line, demonstrating the conservation of momentum and energy.
- **Angular Collisions:** Models collisions at an angle, reflecting more intricate billiard dynamics.
- **Pi Approximation:** Uses colliding balls to approximate the value of Ï€, inspired by Grant Sanderson's (3Blue1Brown) video.

**Skills:** Matrices, NumPy, Mathematical Modeling
