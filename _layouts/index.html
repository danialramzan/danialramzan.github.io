This website was built with Jekyll, HTML, CSS, and Liquid, and deployed using Ruby. I also integrated Google Analytics into the website, because I actually find working with data very interesting.

<!-- Speaking of Google Analytics, I see this website has recently started to gain plenty of traction from what I assume are job recruiters and hiring managers.
