This website was built with Jekyll, HTML, CSS, and Liquid, and deployed using Ruby. I also integrated Google Analytics into the website, because I love working with data.

Speaking of Google Analytics, I see this website has recently started to gain plenty of traction from what I assume are job recruiters and hiring managers (mainly from the United States).


<a href="assets/surelythiswillwork.jpg" style="width: 450px; text-decoration: underline;">If you're one of them: Hi, Nice to meet you!</a>

###### I have experience with a wide range of technologies, including C/C++, CSS, Docker, Expo, HTML, Java, Node.JS, PostgreSQL, Python, R, Racket, React Native, TypeORM, Typescript, and Linux Based Systems, amongst countless others.
###### Those who have taken a chance on me have seen the value in their decision, and I work hard to deliver results they can trust.


### What do I like to do other than code?
- Keeping up to date with politics
- Listening to music
- Travelling
- Gaming
- Studying/Reading up on anything that isn't coursework.
